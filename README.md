# Instagram-Followers
Repository allowing users to get followers list and follower count for a given day. User can run main.py script each day and check the difference 
in followers between the dates. Python script allows users to determine which accounts unfollowed them, and any new accounts that may have followed them.
In addition, the difference between the text files is to be checked manually between an online text difference detector (such as https://www.diffchecker.com).

A text file will be created containing the follower count and followers list for a given date. User can create as many text logs as they wish, and check the difference between
any two given dates or timeframe. (Text difference hasn't been implemented into project yet). 

I was getting quite sick of using the Iphone applications that hack your account information, or provide you with inaccurate results. So I went ahead and implemented 
the application myself. All you have to do is provide your sign in credentials into the username and password variables and run the script. 
Please ensure that you have Python 3.6 atleast, and the instaloader package installed on your machine. If not, 
run [pip3 install instaloader].
